**The exportesrigdbd is the preferred way to export the data. I included the Geopackage for historical context** 
**The state needs an ESRI File Geodatabase so I fill in an "empty one" with the data from PostgreSQL. There is less complaining from the state doing that** 

**Things you need to know:** 

-host which would be an ip address 
-user which would be a database user 
-password which would be the above users password 
-location of the Template and the TCSTransport Upload Folder
